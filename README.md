Great! The build completed successfully. Your project is now ready for deployment. Here's the complete guide to host on Render:

Step 1: Push to GitHub
Create a new repository on GitHub
Push your project code to the repository:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
Step 2: Deploy on Render
Go to render.com and sign up/login
Click "New" → "Web Service"
Connect your GitHub repository
Configure the service:
Name: staff-attendance-app (or your choice)
Runtime: Node
Build Command: npm install && npm run build
Start Command: npm run preview
Environment: Production
Step 3: Environment Variables
Since your app uses Firebase, add these environment variables in Render:

VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
Step 4: Deploy
Click "Create Web Service" and Render will build and deploy your app automatically.

Your app will be available at a URL like: https://your-app-name.onrender.com

The build was successful with a 538KB bundle size, which is reasonable for a React app with Firebase and Lucide icons.
